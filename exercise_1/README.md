This exercise shows a system that implements logging system through async.

In this example, we are creating an audit trail for an application that logs interactions. This is an important
part of many products that use sensitive data, like in the medical field. We want to log that user's actions, but we do
not want that logging action to hold up the program because we still want to facilitate a quick user experience.
